This project is a clone of the Netflix homepage, built with **React**, **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**. It is a frontend project, meaning that it focuses on the user interface and does not include backend functionality. The movie and TV show titles, descriptions, and images displayed on this webpage are sourced from the **TMDB (The Movie Database) API**. 

## Setting up the project

In the root folder of the project, run the following command to install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the project with the following command

```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the Next.js development server, and you can view the page in your browser by going to **http://localhost:3000**.
