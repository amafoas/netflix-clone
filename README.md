This project is a clone of the Netflix homepage, built with React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. It is a frontend project, meaning that it focuses on the user interface and does not include backend functionality. The movie and TV show titles, descriptions, and images displayed on this webpage are sourced from the TMDB (The Movie Database) API.
